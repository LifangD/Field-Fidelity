Factual correctness relative to the reference answer is paramount. Between two correct responses, the one with appropriate uncertainty calibration is better - confident answers for clear facts, uncertain answers for ambiguous information, and acknowledgment of limitations when lacking reliable data. Finally, among those, prefer responses that are clear, relevant, and well-formatted.

Crucially, a correct and concise response always outranks an incorrect but detailed one. Responses containing clear factual errors or meaningless characters/irrelevant content receive low scores regardless of other qualities.

For uncertainty matching: uncertain or unknown responses are correct for inherently ambiguous questions, while unnecessary uncertainty for clear factual questions incurs mild penalties. Responses significantly longer than reference (>150% length) or containing repetitive patterns (>20% n-gram overlap) are penalized for format issues.
