**Step 1: Atomic Decomposition**\n\n1. The image shows a bed with a white duvet.\n2. The bed has multiple pillows.\n3. There are at least four pillows visible.\n4. Two large pillows are white.\n5. One smaller pillow is white.\n6. One decorative pillow is blue with a leaf pattern.\n7. There might be more pillows underneath or partially obscured.\n\n**Step 2: Importance Classification**\n\n1. Core facts directly answering the question, key objects/relationships/quantities: 3, 4, 5, 6\n2. Supplementary details, descriptions, inferential statements: 1, 2, 7\n\n**Step 3: Individual Scoring**\n\n| Atomic Claim | Importance | Weight | Score | Evidence | Weighted Score |\n|--------------|------------|--------|-------|----------|----------------|\n| 1. White duvet | Secondary | 0.5 | 1 | Consistent with image | 0.5 |\n| 2. Multiple pillows | Secondary | 0.5 | 1 | Consistent with image | 0.5 |\n| 3. At least four pillows visible | Main | 1.0 | 1 | Consistent with image | 1.0 |\n| 4. Two large white pillows | Main | 1.0 | 1 | Consistent with image | 1.0 |\n| 5. One smaller white pillow | Main | 1.0 | 1 | Consistent with image | 1.0 |\n| 6. One blue decorative pillow with leaf pattern | Main | 1.0 | 1 | Consistent with image | 1.0 |\n| 7. More pillows might be underneath/obscured | Secondary | 0.5 | 0.5 | Reasonable uncertainty | 0.25 |\n\n**Step 4: Weighted Aggregation**\n\nRaw Score = Σ(Weighted Score) ÷ Σ(Weight) = (0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.25) ÷ (0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.5) = 5.25 ÷ 5.5 = 0.955\n\n**Step 5: Final Adjustments**\n\n- **Professional Bonus**: +0.1 (explicitly mentions possible occlusion)\n- **Redundancy Penalty**: -0.1 (slightly repetitive)\n- **Critical Override Check**: No Main claim = 0\n\nFinal Score = clip(0.955 + 0.1 - 0.1, 0, 1) = 0.955\n\n【Score】\\boxed{0.96}
